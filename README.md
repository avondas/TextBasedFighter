# TextBasedFighter
A small Rust project, where you can choose your fighter in the terminal and battle one of a couple of enemies, all in text
I just wanted to try out Rust and thought this would be a fun project to do (this was before I found out that Rust doesn't like OOP so it was a bit of a challenge figuring out the steps).
It was a bit strange to toss what I learned during my study out the window, but I got to try something new and find out some new stuff.
